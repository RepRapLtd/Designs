# Summary

The Andy hexapod is loosely based on the Phoenix hexapod from lynxmotion.

See a movie of Andy - the hexapod, in action:
https://youtu.be/f40JUxppfhM



# Print Settings

Printer: Ecksbot 3D - K8200 Velleman - Prusa i3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: 0.1 mm
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
just print the parts, no support needed ...
Every part is designed to fit well within a standard 20x20x20cm 3D printer.

If you have a larger printvolume, you can print the top and bottom of the frame, each in one piece. Otherwise you have to print the top in 4 pieces and the bottom also. You can glue it afterwards, but it will also be held together with screws that are already needed for further assembly.


# Post-Printing

You will also need:
- lots of M3 nuts, bolts and screws.(shortest=8mm, longest=70 mm)
- 18x MG996R servos
- 1x BotBoarduino (you can buy the from lynxmotion.com)
- 1x SSC-32 (also from lynxmotion.com)
- 1x PS3 wireless controller
- 1x PS3 wireless receiver
- 6x ball bearings (3mm ID - 6mm OD - 5mm thick - use them in the lower part, to connect the brackets without friction to the body)

Look here how to power the BotBoarduino and how to connect it to the SSC-32 and the PS2 wireless receiver:
http://www.lynxmotion.com/images/html/build185.htm

I use the same connection schematic as the phoenix hexapod from lynxmotion.com
take a look here: http://www.lynxmotion.com/images/html/build99f.htm

The botboarduino is an arduino-based board, so use the included ino file, to get the
hexapod up and running, and control it with the PS3 controller :-)

For the mechanical assembly, it should speak for itself how to do that.
(In case of questions, post them in the comment section, I will answer them, and if necessary take detailled pictures for further explanation)
